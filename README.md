The submitted code contains unit tests for utility functions and documentation for all the code.

### To run tests
```bash
npm test
```

**NOTE**: The 8 `todo` tets are 4 integration tests each for the handlers. I haven't figured out how to do them yet.

### To generate documentation
```bash
npm run docs:gen
```

The documentation generated by JSDoc will be in the out folder.
